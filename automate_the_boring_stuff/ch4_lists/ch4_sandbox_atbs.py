# Chapter 4 - Lists

#* List value = list itself
#* Items in list separated by commas
#* Lists begin and end with square brackets

names = ['Bob', 'Devan', 'Sean', 'Spencer']

#! Nesting lists inside of lists can be done by simply adding another pair of square brackets as one of the values

stuff = ['baseball', 'basketball', ['cat','dog']]

#! Access the stuff in the nested list by using two indexes:

print(stuff[2][0]) #? Prints cat
